# some-kind-of-aesthetic
Simple html+sass web page created purely for purpose of experimenting with styling and looks 

...and it kind of looks like tumblr blog which I could have had in highschool.

Regarding the background to look like from a notebook, I found this articles to be useful sources of knowledge:
- https://projects.verou.me/css3patterns/
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients


In order to make sass work I used this command line : 

```
sass --watch style.scss:style.css

```
